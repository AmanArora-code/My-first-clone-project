ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone Project
Welcome to the Spotify Clone Project! This project is a non-functioning clone of Spotifyâ€™s website, created using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the visual design and layout of certain sections of Spotifyâ€™s web player.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web pages.

ðŸŽ¨ Font and Icons
Due to Spotifyâ€™s proprietary fonts and icons, the following alternatives were used:

Fonts: Google Fonts was utilized to select a font resembling Spotifyâ€™s interface.
Icons: FontAwesomeâ€™s free icons were used to replicate Spotifyâ€™s iconography. Additionally, custom images were used as icons in some areas.

ðŸŒŸ Features
This clone project includes:

Sidebar Navigation: Similar to Spotifyâ€™s web player.
Library Section: With customizable options.
Responsive Design: For different screen sizes.
Styled Cards: To display music content.
